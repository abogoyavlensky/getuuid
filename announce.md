## Streamlined Unique Identifier Generation

I am excited to announce the launch of [GetUUID](https://getuuid.top/), a free, open-source web tool designed to make unique identifier generation effortless for anyone who needs quick access to standardized IDs.

## Why I Built GetUUID

In today's development landscape, unique identifiers are essential building blocks for databases, distributed systems, and web applications. Whether you're designing a microservice architecture, creating test data, or building a new application from scratch, you need reliable ways to generate unique IDs.

I found that existing tools were often bloated with unnecessary features, had poor user experiences, or were limited to only one type of ID format. GetUUID solves these problems with a clean, minimalist approach that puts the focus on what matters: generating IDs quickly and efficiently.

## Multiple ID Formats to Suit Every Need

GetUUID supports multiple identifier formats to accommodate different use cases:

- **UUID v4**: The industry standard random UUID with strong uniqueness guarantees, perfect for most general purposes
- **UUID v1**: Time-based UUIDs that include MAC address information, ideal for scenarios requiring chronological ordering
- **UUID v7**: The newest UUID standard offering time-ordered identifiers with improved sortability, excellent for database performance
- **ULID**: Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifiers combine the benefits of timestamp ordering with the uniqueness of random IDs
- **Nano ID**: Compact, URL-friendly unique string IDs, perfect for shorter identifiers in web applications

## Key Features That Make Development Easier

GetUUID was designed with developer productivity in mind:

- **One-Click Copy**: Generate and copy IDs to your clipboard with a single click
- **Local History**: Automatically tracks your last 50 generated IDs, all stored securely in your browser's local storage
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear visual confirmation when IDs are copied
- **Zero Dependencies**: Works offline once loaded – perfect for development environments without internet access
- **Responsive Design**: Fully functional on both desktop and mobile devices
- **No Server-Side Processing**: All operations happen in your browser for maximum privacy

## Practical Applications

GetUUID is invaluable across numerous development scenarios:

- **Database Design**: Generate primary keys for new database tables
- **API Development**: Create unique identifiers for resources in RESTful APIs
- **Test Data Generation**: Quickly populate test environments with unique records
- **Distributed Systems**: Ensure uniqueness across multiple services without coordination
- **Logging and Tracing**: Generate correlation IDs for tracking requests across microservices
- **URL Shortening**: Use Nano IDs for compact, unique URL identifiers

## Modern, Accessible Design

I've built GetUUID with a clean, neo-brutalist design that's both visually appealing and highly accessible. The interface is intuitive and distraction-free, allowing you to focus on the task at hand.

## Open Source and Community-Driven

GetUUID is fully open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/abogoyavlensky/getuuid). I welcome contributions, feature requests, and feedback from the developer community.
